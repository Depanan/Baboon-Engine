# Baboon-Engine
Experimental Vulkan engine for learning purposes.

This is my attempt to understand how Vulkan works.
The aim of this project so far is learning this new and exciting technology so expect to find tons of mistakes ;)
Working only on windows at the moment, with time I'll be glad to support other platforms.

A camera is provided with the following controls:

Movement: ASDW
Rotation: Use the mouse right click + movement.

I'm using ImGUI for the menus. At the moment thru the options menu item you can inspect some app metrics (FPS and cam position so far) and
load different scenes. Some sample scenes are provided.
